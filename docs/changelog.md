## [0.10.0] - 2021-03-11

**After updating to this version your configuration file and genome assets will not be compatible with the software. Please refer to the [upgrade tutorial](config_upgrade_03_to_04.md) for instructions on how to migrate the config between versions.**

- asset files are now named after genome digests
- refgenieserver APIv3 is now used for remote assets retrieval
- `RefGenConf.genomes` becomes an `AliasedYacAttMap` object

### Removed

- `as_string` and `order` option from `listr` method

### Added

- `upgrade_config` function for genome configuration file migrating between versions
- `RefGenConf.compare` method for genome compatibility level determination

- numerous `RefGenConf` object properties and methods related to genome aliases handling: `genome_aliases`, `genome_aliases_table`, `alias_dir`, `data_dir`, `get_genome_alias`, `get_genome_alias_digest`, `remove_genome_aliases`, `set_genome_alias`, `initialize_genome`. Refer to [API documentation](http://refgenie.databio.org/en/latest/autodoc_build/refgenconf/) for more specific information.
- `get_asset_table` method, which displays a concise assets table

### Added

- `force_large` argument in the `pull` method, which can be used to handle large archive downloads
- `add` method

### Changed

- `getseq` method returns the sequence string instead of printing it to the screen

### Deprecated

- `get_remote_data_str` method. Use `listr` instead

## [0.9.0] - 2020-07-01

- file locking mechanism enhancements

## [0.8.0] - 2020-06-25

- dropped Python 2 support

### Removed

- preciously deprecated `get_asset` method. Use `seek` instead

## [0.7.0] - 2020-03-17

### Added

- `RefGenConf` methods update the file on disk that's bound to the object if one exists
- `seek` method. Works similarily to `get_asset`, but does not check for asset file existence on disk by default.

### Added

- `get_asset_digest` method for asset digest retrieval
- `dir` to the `filepath` method to return an archive enclosing directory

- the way of distribution of `refgenieserver` endpoints operationIds. They are grouped and mapped to a short description

### Fixed

- overloaded colon in progress bar descriptions; [#73](https://github.com/refgenie/refgenconf/issues/73)

- local and remote listing restriction by genome. These methods accept an optional `genome` argument:
  - `list_local`
  - `list_remote`
  - `assets_dict`
  - `assets_str`

## [0.3.0] - 2019-07-11

### Changed
